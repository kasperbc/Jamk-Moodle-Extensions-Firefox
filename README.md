## Installation
1. Download the xpi file from the releases
2. If you are using Firefox, the browser might prompt you to install it straight away. If this happens, you can skip to step 6. If not,
3. Open "Add-ons and themes" on Firefox
4. Click the gear icon and select "Install Add-on From File..."
5. Select the xpi file
6. The extension should be installed now. By default it probably won't run automatically, so to set it so that it does, open any course on moodle, select the extension in the extensions menu and set it to "Always allow on moodle.jamk.fi"
